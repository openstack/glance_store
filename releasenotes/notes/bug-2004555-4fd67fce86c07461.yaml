    Cinder glance_store driver: in order to avoid a situation where a
    leftover device could be mapped to a different volume than the one
    intended, the cinder glance_store driver now instructs the os-brick
    library to force detach volumes, which ensures that devices are
    removed from the host.

    See `Bug #2004555
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/glance-store/+bug/2004555>`_ for more
    information about this issue.
