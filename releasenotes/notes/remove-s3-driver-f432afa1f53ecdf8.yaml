    glance_store._drivers.s3 removed from tree.
upgrade:
  - The S3 driver has been removed completely from the
    glance_store source tree. All environments running
    and (or) using this s3-driver piece of code and have
    not been migrated will stop working after the upgrade.
    We recommend you use a different storage backend that
    is still being supported by Glance. The standard
    deprecation path has been used to remove this. The
    process requiring store driver maintainers was initiated
    at http://lists.openstack.org/pipermail/openstack-dev/2015-December/081966.html .
    Since, S3 driver did not get any maintainer, it was
    decided to remove it.
