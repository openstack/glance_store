    `Bug #2056179 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/glance-store/+bug/2056179>`_:
    Cinder Store: Fix issue when updating legacy image location.
    Previously we only used the user context's credentials to make request
    to cinder which we have now updated to use the service credentials
    configured in the config file else use the user context's credentials.
