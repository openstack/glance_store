deprecations:
  - |
    The ``filesystem_store_datadirs`` option has been deprecated in this
    release and is subject to removal at the beginning of the `H` (2026.2)
    development cycle, following the `OpenStack standard deprecation policy
    <https://governance.openstack.org/reference/tags/assert_follows-standard-deprecation.html>`_.

    Users should configure multiple filesystem stores instead of using this
    option.
