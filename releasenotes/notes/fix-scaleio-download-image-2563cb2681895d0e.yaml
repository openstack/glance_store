    Cinder (Dell PowerFlex) `bug #2086759
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/glance-store/+bug/2086759>`_:
    Fixed issue when downloading an image.
    Previously, we used to fail trying to download an image when using
    Glance -> Cinder -> Dell PowerFlex configuration which is now fixed
    with better file handling for the volume device.
