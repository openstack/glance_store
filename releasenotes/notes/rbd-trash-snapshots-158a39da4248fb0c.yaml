    The RBD driver now moves images to the trash if they cannot be deleted
    immediately due to having snapshots. This fixes the long-standing issue
    where base images are unable to be deleted until/unless all snapshots of
    it are also deleted. Moving the image to the trash allows Glance to
    proceed with the deletion of the image (as far as it is concerned), mark
    the RBD image for deletion, which will happen once the last snapshot that
    uses it has been deleted.
