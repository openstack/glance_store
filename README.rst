Glance Store Library
====================

Glance's stores library

This library has been extracted from the Glance source code for the
specific use of the Glance and Glare projects.

The API it exposes is not stable, has some shortcomings, and is not a
general purpose interface. We would eventually like to change this,
but for now using this library outside of Glance or Glare will not be
supported by the core team.
